Welcome to my personal Power BI portfolio repository! Here you will find a collection of Power BI projects and dashboards that demonstrate my skills and expertise in data visualization, business intelligence, and analytics using Power BI.

## [Project 1: ESPN Cricket Dashboard](https://github.com/kevinlch421/ESPN-Batting-and-Fielding-Dashboard.git)

The ESPN Cricket Dashboard is a data visualization and analysis project that uses web-scraped data from ESPN to create an interactive dashboard. This dashboard focuses on batting and fielding statistics from the India and South Africa cricket teams. Built with DAX functions and Power BI, it provides an intuitive interface for users to explore and analyze cricket performance metrics.
